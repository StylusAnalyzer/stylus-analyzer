# Static Analysis Implementation Notes

## Overview

We've added a static analysis feature to the Stylus Analyzer tool for detecting common vulnerabilities in Stylus/Rust smart contracts. The implementation focuses on detecting unchecked transfers and unsafe transfer patterns, with a modular design that allows for easy extension with additional detectors in the future.

## Architecture

The static analyzer consists of the following components:

1. **Base Detector**: An abstract base class that defines the interface for all detectors.
2. **Specific Detectors**: Implementations of the base detector that look for specific issues:
   - `UncheckedTransferDetector`: Finds instances where transfer return values are not checked
   - `UnsafeTransferDetector`: Identifies transfers to potentially unsafe or unvalidated addresses
3. **Static Analyzer**: Main class that coordinates the analysis process and manages detectors
4. **CLI Integration**: Command-line interface for running the static analysis

## Implementation Details

### Detector System

Each detector follows these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each detector looks for a specific type of issue
2. **AST Traversal**: Detectors walk the AST to find patterns of interest
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Some detectors analyze surrounding code to determine if an issue exists

### Analysis Process

The static analysis process follows these steps:

1. Parse the Rust code to generate an AST using tree-sitter
2. Instantiate and register all available detectors
3. For each detector, run its detection logic on the AST
4. Collect all issues found by the detectors
5. Present findings to the user through the CLI

## Future Extensions

The modular design makes it easy to extend the analyzer with additional detectors:

1. **New Detector Types**: Create additional detectors for other common issues in Stylus/Rust contracts
2. **Advanced Analysis**: Implement more sophisticated data flow and control flow analysis
3. **Configuration Options**: Allow users to enable/disable specific detectors or customize severity thresholds
4. **Code Suggestions**: Provide automated fixes for detected issues

## Testing

Unit tests verify that:

1. The analyzer correctly identifies issues in contracts with known vulnerabilities
2. The analyzer doesn't report false positives for safe code

## Usage

The static analyzer can be used through the CLI:

```bash
# Analyze a single file
stylus-analyzer static-analyze path/to/contract.rs

# Analyze all contracts in a directory
stylus-analyzer static-analyze path/to/project/

# Save results to a file
stylus-analyzer static-analyze path/to/contract.rs -o results.json
```
